This resource is based on the &quot;Listening Tasks for Senior Secondary School 
Students of Japanese&quot; published by the Melbourne Centre for Japanese Language 
Education in 2001.<br>
<br>
This CD-ROM is designed for multipurpose teaching and learning. Learners can 
plan and practice their listening at their own pace. This resource<br>
also allows teachers to integrate the use of computers into their curriculum 
ensuring that the ICT features in their course work, further developing useful 
and relevant skills.<br>
　</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial Narrow">This CD-ROM 
listening resource is designed for Years 11 and 12 students. Each task contains 
an audio file, questions, vocabulary list and sample<br>
answers. Approximately 80 new 'preparation activities' have also been included 
in this resource, to address common linguistic elements that<br>
can cause students difficulty.<br>
